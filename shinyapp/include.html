<h2><font color="#aec6cf">Gonorrhoea</font></h2>
Gonorrhoea is a sexually transmitted disease that can be spread both via unprotected sex and from mother to baby during pregnancy, labour, or breastfeeding. It is easily treatable, but left unchecked can involve weeks or even months of unpleasant symptoms. In some cases, untreated gonorrhoea can lead to permanent health problems such as infertility.

This simulation of gonorrhoea aims to be as realistic as possible in both design and default settings, while still allowing the user to experiment with sometimes implausible - though not impossible - parameters.

<h4>Condom usage:</h4>

We allow the user to explore the effect of consistent condom usage by a fraction of the population, based on the assumption that this only applies when a man is involved in the sexual encounter. Since this is specific to the behaviour in a population of interest, it is also set to a neutral default value.

<h4>Sexual contact rates:</h4>
    
Since gonorrhoea can be spread both homosexually and heterosexually, we allow for the specification of different contact rates for each category of sexual contact. The model allows for the average woman to have a different number of contacts with men than the average man does with women. These contact rates are largely dependent on the behaviour in a specific population and have been set to neutral default values of 0.5.

<h4>Treatment parameters:</h4>

Natural recovery from gonorrhoea can take weeks to months; we start the simulation by assuming one month. Drug treatment usually reduces symptoms within a few days, and after two weeks a previously infected person should test negatively for gonorrhoea. On average, we assume that people take seven days to seek treatment - because there is often an incubation period of up to two weeks in which a person is asymptomatic but infectious - and two weeks to be cured. 

Until treatment is complete, the person remains infectious. We allow both for people who abstain from unprotected sex during treatment - the proportion of which is assumed to be high - and for those who do not. Note that contracting gonorrhoea once does not generally imply future immunity; however, we include a parameter for immunity for the userâ€™s interest.

<h4>Omissions:</h4>

In some cases, a baby might contract gonorrhoea from an infected mother. In these cases, the baby develops an eye infection and if untreated, further health issues which can be fatal. Since this form of gonorrhoea is not spread or experienced as it is in adulthood, it is omitted from the model. 

Growing antibiotic resistance is making gonorrhoea more difficult to treat in certain parts of the world. The effect of this on the spread of the disease has not been modelled.
